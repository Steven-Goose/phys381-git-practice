This is a placeholder for my project description for Assignment 17!

CONTENTS:
This repo contains a exercises to familiarize us with how git and GitHub work.
This includes:
    - This README.md file
    - "hello.py" as a sample Python program that just prints a simple message to the console
    - A folder with a collection of physics related Python notebooks that for some reason are written mostly in Russian.
    
I chose to look at the notebook titled "Pendulum."
    This notebook models the behavior of a pendulum. It takes the 2nd order ODE governing the motion and uses scipy.integrate.odeint() to solve the system given an initial condition. Then it displays this result in a variety of ways, showing the way the angle varies with time, the angular acceleration, and the phase portrait. Then they show how this compares to an analytic model of attenuated oscillations. They show a few more ways to display this interactively, including a very nice animation, and finally they do a little discussion of some kind of complex analysis.
